# Project Overview
## Description:
Cyberbullying has been around since the start of the internet. 
Cyberbullies often use a language of their own, also known as hate speech.
Our research project aims to use a pre-labeled dataset of cyberbullying tweets (labelled as cyberbullying versus not cyberbullying) as a training set to train our model.
We will create a vocabulary of hate speech, and try to see what language is most commonly used by cyberbullies. 
We want to use the dataset and this vocabulary to predict whether a user is a cyberbully or not in the following way:
We will build a test set using Twitterâ€™s API and evaluate our results against tweets from random users to classify them as bullies or not. 
(p.s- We still need to do more research on a good metric to determine whether a user is a bully, which is why that part of the description is a bit vague.)


## Research question:
What sort of language is commonly used by cyberbullies? Can we use this as a basis to predict whether a user is a cyberbully?


## Dataset:

...and probably straight from Twitter

## Split of work:
   Amaan: Testing and Evaluation + Scraping
   Tori: Pre-processing
   Yiyang: Training model + visualisation 


## Milestones:
    End of 1w: Wrap up research on metric
    End of 2w: Pre-processing, visualisation
    End of 3w: Building vocabulary, training model 
    End of 5w: Starting with testing on validation set  
    End of 6w: Finished product + submission
